# 🧠 MNIST-from-Scratch

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The primary objective is to understand the inner workings of neural networks without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`

You can install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the Notebook

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adheesh101/MNIST-from-Scratch.git
   ```
### 🏃‍♂️ Running the Notebook

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd MNIST-from-Scratch
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open and run `mnist-from-scratch.ipynb`:**

   Execute the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the neural network.
